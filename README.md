# 3D terrain generation with Perlin Noise Demo

Repository for a demo of 3D terrain generation using Perlin Noise created for a presentation.

`perlin.js` was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/wwwtyro/perlin.js).

`three.js` is a [JavaScript 3D library](https://threejs.org/).

# How to Run

Open a terminal and clone the repository into the directory of your choosing

`$ git clone https://github.com/omakk/3d_terrain_gen_demo.git`

Next, open `index.html` in your preferred browser and voila!

You are welcome and encouraged to play around with the variables to manipulate the terrain. The relevant variables that manipulate the look of terrain have associated comments describing their effects on the terrain.

Enjoy!
